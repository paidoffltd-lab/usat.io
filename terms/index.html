              <h2>16. Governing law and other miscellaneous terms of the Site</h2>
              <p><b>16.1 - Governing law. </b>These Terms shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and shall be interpreted in all respects as a British Virgin Islands contract. Any dispute, controversy, claim or action arising from or related to your access or use of the Site or these Terms likewise shall be governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, exclusive of choice-of-law principles.</p>
              <p><b>16.2 - Jurisdiction. </b>We both agree that the courts of the British Virgin Islands will have exclusive jurisdiction. The foregoing shall be without prejudice to any applicable provisions of mandatory consumer protection laws under the laws of your country of residence, if and only to the extent that these offer you more protection.</p>
              <p><b>16.3 - Class Action Waiver. </b>Each Party expressly intends and agrees that: (a) class action and representative action procedures are hereby waived and will not be asserted, nor will they apply, in any dispute pursuant to these Terms; (b) neither Party will assert class action or representative action claims against the other in arbitration or otherwise; (c) each Party will only submit its own, individual claims in any dispute and will not seek to represent the interests of any other Person, or consolidate claims with any other person; (d) nothing in these Terms will be interpreted as either Party’s intent to adjudicate claims on a class or representative basis; and (e) any relief awarded to any one user of the Site cannot and may not affect any other user of the Site. No adjudicator may consolidate or join more than one Person’s or Party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.</p>
              <p><b>16.4 - Jury Trial Waiver. </b>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR ANY BREACH THEREOF, ANY USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE SITE BY YOU OR ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING THE PARTIES.</p>
              <p><b>16.5 - Headings: </b>The headings and sub-headings in these Terms are for ease of reference only and are not to be taken into account in the construction or interpretation of any provision or provisions to which they refer.</p>
              <p><b>16.6 - Extended Meanings. </b>Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, words importing the singular include the plural and vice versa, and words importing gender include all genders. The words “include”, “includes”, or “including” will be interpreted on an inclusive basis and be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”.</p>
              <p><b>16.7 - Assignment; Third-Party Rights. </b>These Terms and any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, are not assignable by you. Any attempt by you to assign these Terms without written consent is void. These Terms and any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained herein are freely assignable by us without notice or your consent (for clarity, this assignment right includes the right for us to assign any claim, in whole or in part, arising hereunder). Subject to the foregoing, these Terms, and any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, personal or legal representatives, successors and assigns of each Party. None of the provisions of these Terms, or any of the rights, duties, and obligations contained or incorporated herein, are for the benefit of or enforceable by any creditors of either Party or any other persons, except such as inure to a successor or assign in accordance herewith and as provided in the following sentence. Our Associates are intended third-party beneficiaries of the rights and privileges expressly stated to apply to Associates hereunder and shall be entitled to enforce such rights and privileges (including those rights and privileges set out in paragraph 15) as if in direct privity under these Terms, subject to the conditions and limitations hereof, including those relating to the resolution of disputes. No consent of any Person is required for any modification or amendment to these Terms.</p>
              <p><b>16.8 - Severability. </b>If any provision of these Terms or part thereof, as amended from time to time, is determined to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability attaches only to such provision to the extent of its illegality, unenforceability, invalidity, or voidness, as may be, and everything else in these Terms continues in full force and effect.</p>
              <p><b>16.9 - No Waivers; Available Remedies. </b>Any failure by us or any Associate to exercise any of its rights, powers, or remedies under these Terms, or any delay in doing so, does not constitute a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy. The single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy does not prevent any of them from exercising any other rights, powers, or remedies. The remedies under these Terms are cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by the provisions of these Terms, or by law or equity and may include (i) injunctions to prevent breaches of these Terms and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and you waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with such remedies; and (ii) the right to recover the amount of any Losses by set off against any amounts that we would otherwise be obligated to pay to you.</p>
